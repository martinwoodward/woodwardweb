I've won a laptop!!  Amazing, never really won anything before (unless you count 1st prize in a fancy dress competition dressed as Worzel Gummage).  All thanks to those every generous people at [Intel Developer Services](http://www.intel.com/ids/).  Will post more details as soon as it arrives.  So far all I know is that it is "an HP Compaq notebook computer featuring Intel Centrino Mobile Technology".  Cool.
